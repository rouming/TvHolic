TvHolic - is an attempt to implement DLNA compatible media server to
watch my favourite *.avi files on my Philips tv.

Last several years I use godddamned PS3 Media Server.
I hate it so much! I hate it so much!

TvHolic must do several things to be my favourite media server:

1. Order files (Hey, PS3MS, kill yourself!)
2. Mux subtitles without transcoding (Fuck you, PS3MS)
3. Not to eat 1GB of RAM while iterating in folder (PS3MS, burn in hell!)
4. Not to spawn thread on every event (PS3MS, you know what to do!)
5. Transcode everything using ffmpeg or mencoder (Ok, PS3MS, you does this)

Actually, the main purpose of this 'yet another DLNA compatible app' is
to be as small as possible and to consume little ammount of resources (RAM, CPU).
